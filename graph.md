Maximal oxygen uptake (<span>V&#x0307;</span>O<sub>2</sub>) is the peak rate of oxygen consumed during exercise. A greater <span>V&#x0307;</span>O<sub>2</sub> max level means that the body is more efficient at delivering oxygen and can change based on the type and intensity of training. Direct and indirect tests can be used to measure this value. 

Below are the results of a direct test done by a 20-year-old female using a cycle ergometer:
